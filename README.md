# Introduction
This is a guide with advice for getting started with web development!

We cover everything you need to know to develop websites, but this guide is not fully encompassing about all aspects of web development, rather a general overview containing all the necessary information.

Web development is the work involved in developing applications for the Internet. Web development covers developing a simple page of plain text to complex interactive web services.

We'll be breaking down the steps for learning web development, its important not to skip sections as they are built on top of each other and each successive section assumes a minimum level of understanding present in the previous sections.

# Basics
If you have no prior experience in web development this is the stuff that you need to know to before progressing into frameworks/librabries

   -  First and foremost [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) is the most useful resource for getting started with Front End Develpment. It has a lot of useful guides for getting started with HTML, CSS, Javascript as well as other interesting topics!

   - For HTML: (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
   - For CSS: (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
   - For JavaScript: (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) 
   - Javascript's importance can't be overstated in web development, as its used by 95% of all websites. By becoming proficient in Javascript, one can get into developing not just websites, but mobile and desktop apps as well.
   - Here's a [list of books](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) to help out with learning javascript. They're free and go into detail about the intricacies of the language.

 # Front-End
 
The front-end is anything that the user sees when they interact with your website. It's important to have visually appealing websites in order to effectively engage your users.

Let's go through some examples of front-end designs to understand why there's a need of visual appeal in websites. We'll present 3 different landing pages, and let you decide which one you like the best.
   
   Down here is an example of a plain text website, its usually composed primarily with HTML. Nothing inherently wrong with it, it presents all the specified information.
   
   The reason why its not that common to see websites with similar structure/design is that not only are sites like this static and they weren't meant to be interactive.

   Moving on, we have an example of bad design, this website presents a lot of useless information combined with poorly implemented CSS.

   Now, coming to great design, Apple is a company that's obsessed with achieving amazing design. Their website has all the qualities of a great website, including a clean minimalistic design that only presents the necessary information.

   - Front end CSS libraries make it easier and faster to design web pages, here are some useful ones to learn:
   
        [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/): It's popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites.
  
        [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/introduction/getting-started.html): Another awesome library that prioritizes concise human-friendly syntax to design beautiful web pages.
  
        [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/): A free and open-source CSS framework based on Flexbook.
        
   - JavaScript libraries are widely used to design web pages    
   
        [React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html): React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. Arguably the most popular framework for building 

# Back-End
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/): Node.js is a powerful Javascript runtime environment that can be used to create the back-end of your web applications. When used with web application frameworks such as [Express](https://expressjs.com/) it allows for the creation of dynamic multi-page web applications.
- For Back-End development, Flavio Copes has a free e-books that go into detail on Node.js and Express.js
   Here's a link to his website: https://flaviocopes.com/
   You'll have to sign up for his weekly newsletter to download the e-books.
   He uploads tutorials related to web development almost daily on his website, so that may be worth checking out.
